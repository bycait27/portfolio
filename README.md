# Portfolio

## Description

This is a simple web portfolio built with Next.js and TypeScript to showcase and share my projects, skills, and a little bit about me. There is also a chat bot that can answer some questions you may have about myself as a developer! The styling of this portfolio was made with CSS Modules, TailwindCSS, and Material UI.
