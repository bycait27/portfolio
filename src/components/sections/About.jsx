                    I am a full-stack web developer and graduate student in computer science. My passion for technology and problem-solving, shaped by a rigorous coding bootcamp and a background in 
                    Psychology, drives me to build user-friendly and engaging web applications. My understanding of human behavior and preferences guides my approach to creating intuitive user interfaces and 
                    robust backend systems.

                I am committed to developing web applications that not only meet technical standards but also resonate with users on a psychological level. As a lifelong learner, I 
                stay current with industry trends and embrace the evolving world of web development, one line of code at a time.
